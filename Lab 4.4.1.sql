-- Creating a Customer Summary Report
-- In this exercise, you will create a customer summary report that summarizes key information about customers in the Sakila database, including their rental history and payment details. 
-- The report will be generated using a combination of views, CTEs, and temporary tables.

USE sakila;

-- Step 1: Create a View
-- First, create a view that summarizes rental information for each customer. 
-- The view should include the customer's ID, name, email address, and total number of rentals (rental_count).
CREATE VIEW rental_summary AS
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name,
    c.email,
    COUNT(r.rental_id) AS rental_count
FROM customer c
JOIN rental r ON c.customer_id = r.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name, c.email;

-- Step 2: Create a Temporary Table

-- Next, create a Temporary Table that calculates the total amount paid by each customer (total_paid). 
-- The Temporary Table should use the rental summary view created in Step 1 to join with the payment table and calculate the total amount paid by each customer.
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temp_payments AS
SELECT 
    rs.customer_id,
    SUM(p.amount) AS total_paid
FROM rental_summary rs
JOIN payment p ON rs.customer_id = p.customer_id
GROUP BY rs.customer_id;

-- Step 3: Create a CTE and the Customer Summary Report
-- Create a CTE that joins the rental summary View with the customer payment summary Temporary Table created in Step 2. 
-- The CTE should include the customer's name, email address, rental count, and total amount paid.
-- Next, using the CTE, create the query to generate the final customer summary report, which should include: 
-- customer name, email, rental_count, total_paid and average_payment_per_rental, this last column is a derived column from total_paid and rental_count.
WITH customer_summary AS (
    SELECT 
        rs.first_name,
        rs.last_name,
        rs.email,
        rs.rental_count,
        tp.total_paid
    FROM rental_summary rs
    JOIN temp_payments tp ON rs.customer_id = tp.customer_id
)

SELECT 
    first_name,
    last_name,
    email,
    rental_count,
    total_paid,
    ROUND(total_paid / rental_count, 2) AS average_payment_per_rental
FROM customer_summary;
